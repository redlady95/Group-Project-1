                Aberg, 24, was acquired by the Oilers in a trade with the Nashville
                Predators on Feb. 25, 2018. He had eight points (two goals, six

                    Selected by the Predators in the second round (No. 37) of the 2012
                    NHL Draft, Aberg came over from Sweden in 2014 and spent most of
                    three seasons with Milwaukee of the American Hockey League.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    He made his NHL debut on May 3, 2016 in the Stanley Cup Playoffs
                    against the San Jose Sharks in Game 3 of the Western Conference
                    Second Round but didn't have a point in two games.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In 2016-17, Aberg had two points (one goal, one assist) in 15 games
                    and five points (two goals, three assists) in 16 playoff games,
                    including the game-winning goal in Game 5 of the Western Conference
                    Final against the Anaheim Ducks that gave the Predators a 3-2 series
                    lead.

                    <br />
                    Aberg had eight points (two goals, six assists) in 37 games in
                    2017-18 for the Predators before being acquired by the Oilers. He
                    made his Edmonton debut on Feb. 27 against the Sharks and had an

                    The 5-foot-10, 175-pound forward grew up outside Minneapolis, where
                    his father, Ted, an All-American at North Carolina State and a
                    member of the College Football Hall of Fame, was a running back for
                    the Minnesota Vikings from 1979-86.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    J.T. played football in his youth but carved out a path to pro
                    sports on the ice, beginning with Rosemount (Minn.) High School, and
                    then with Waterloo of the United States Hockey League. He had a
                    stellar two-year stint at the University of Minnesota-Duluth; he was
                    named the most outstanding player at the 2011 Frozen Four, when he
                    helped the Bulldogs to an NCAA championship as a freshman, and was
                    named to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association's all-league
                    first team in 2012.

                    <br />
                    Brown left college after two years, went undrafted and signed with
                    Tampa Bay on March 28, 2012. After appearing in the final five games
                    of the 2011-12 season with the Lightning, Brown played for the
                    United States at the IIHF World Championship in 2012.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since being called up from the American Hockey League on Nov. 12,
                    2013, Brown has emerged as a high-energy forechecker capable of
                    getting under the skin of his opponents with a relentless approach.

                    scored five goals -- two in overtime. In the fourth playoff game of

                    He returned healthy in 2017-18 and had NHL career highs in goals

                    Fiala again showed his playoff prowess in Game 2 of the Western

                    <br />
                    The Sabres selected Foligno in the fourth round (No. 104) in the
                    2009 NHL Draft after he scored 12 goals and 30 points in 65 games
                    during the 2008-09 season. In 2010-11, Foligno finished third on the
                    team in scoring with 59 points. He was selected as the best body
                    checker in the Eastern Conference in the OHL Coaches Poll and was
                    named to the league's Second All-Star Team.

                    <br />
                    Making his international debut at the 2011 World Junior
                    Championship, held in Buffalo, Foligno, a Buffalo native, scored two
                    goals and four points in seven games as Canada won the silver medal.

                    <br />
                    The 6-foot-3, 226-pound Foligno began the 2011-12 season with
                    Rochester of the American Hockey League and in 60 games led the team
                    with five game-winning goals. He was named Rochester's rookie of the
                    year.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Recalled on four occasions Foligno finished with six goals and 13
                    points in 14 games for the Sabres in 2011-12. His NHL debut was a
                    family affair, Dec. 20, 2011, against the Ottawa Senators and older
                    brother Nick. Foligno enjoyed a five-game point streak from March
                    10-19, 2012, including his first NHL goal March 10, 2012, at Ottawa,
                    and his first multipoint game on March 14, 2012, against the
                    Colorado Avalanche.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    He was the third player in Sabres history to record seven or more
                    points in his first six career games, joining Phil Housley (nine)
                    and Ray Sheppard (seven). Foligno's 26.1 percent shooting percentage
                    led the Sabres. He was named the NHL's Rookie of the Month for March
                    2012 after posting six goals and 11 points in 11 games.

                    During the 2012-13 season, Foligno finished third on the Sabres with
                    108 hits. He logged a four-game point streak from Jan. 27-Feb. 2,
                    2013, and scored twice against the New York Rangers on March 12,

                Kunin, a forward born in Chesterfield, Missouri, was chosen by the

                    Kunin had to overcome being diagnosed with Type I diabetes while in
                    the sixth grade. He attended Whitfield School in Missouri for one
                    year before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program
                    and graduating from high school in three years.

                    <br />
                    Kunin played two seasons at the University of Wisconsin. His nine
                    goals in 2015-16 were third among NCAA freshmen. The following
                    season, he became the second sophomore captain in school history and
                    the first since Mike Eaves 40 years earlier. Kunin led the Badgers
                    with 22 goals and 38 points in 35 games, to make the All-Big Ten
                    Second Team.

                    <br />
                    Kunin ended his collegiate career by signing a three-year contract
                    with the Wild on March 23, 2017. He scored his first NHL goal in a
                    6-4 win against the New York Islanders on Oct. 26, 2017; he's the
                    first player in Wild history to do so while shorthanded.

                    <br />
                    Kunin was sent back to the American Hockey League on Oct. 29. He
                    represented Iowa at the 2018 AHL All-Star Game and was recalled by
                    Minnesota on Feb. 28, 2018. However, his season ended with a torn

                A hockey player's son born and raised in Minnesota, the "State of

                    <br />
                    At 5-foot-11, somewhat undersized for an NHL winger, the Minneapolis
                    native was selected No. 17 by the New Jersey Devils in the 2003 NHL
                    Draft. A Hobey Baker Award nominee in each of his two seasons at the
                    University of North Dakota, the son of longtime Minnesota North
                    Stars player and assistant coach J.P. Parise quickly proved himself
                    to be a gifted scorer with great speed in the pro game.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Sent to the American Hockey League for 2004-05 during the NHL
                    lockout, he scored 18 goals and 58 points in 73 games during an
                    all-star season with Albany. After the NHL labor dispute was
                    settled, Parise joined the Devils as a rookie for the 2005-06 season
                    and had 14 goals and 32 points in 81 games.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In October of 2006, Parise scored 26 seconds into New Jersey's
                    season opener, a team record for fastest goal to start a season. He
                    earned MVP honors with a two-goal, six-point performance at the 2007
                    YoungStars game and finished the season with 31 goals and 62 points
                    in 82 games.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was the first of four straight 30-plus goal seasons for Parise.
                    He was named an alternate captain for the Devils to start 2008-09,
                    when he would finish third in the League with 45 goals and fifth in
                    scoring with 94 points while being named a second-team All-Star.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Parise was remarkably healthy during seven seasons with New Jersey;
                    knee surgery that limited him to 13 games in 2010-11 marked the only
                    time Parise missed more than one game for the Devils. It was also
                    the only time New Jersey missed the playoffs during his time there.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Named captain to start the 2011-12 season, Parise had 31 goals and
                    69 points in the regular season and helped lead New Jersey to its
                    first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 2003. The Devils lost the
                    Final to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. Parise tied for first
                    in the League with eight playoff goals and tied for sixth with 15
                    points.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A free agent after the season, Parise signed a 13-year, $98 million
                    contracts to join his hometown Minnesota Wild. With 18 goals and 38
                    points in 48 games during the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season,
                    Parise helped the Wild return to the playoffs for the first time in
                    five seasons.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A high school national champion at the renowned Shattuck-St. Mary's
                    School where his father served as director of hockey, Parise won
                    gold with the United States at the 2004 World Junior Championships
                    and silver at the 2010 Olympics.

            <p class="card-text">
                Born in Southern California, Zucker moved to Las Vegas with his
                family when he was an infant and would become both the first
                Nevada-raised draft <span id="dots">...

                    <br />
                    The forward was the Minnesota Wild's second-round pick (No. 59) in
                    the 2010 NHL Draft, and it's no wonder he became one of the fastest
                    skaters in the league: His mother, Natalie, is a former competitive
                    figure skater, and his father, Scott, is a general contractor who
                    built ice and roller rinks when Jason was young, allowing his then
                    kindergarten-aged son hours a day of free skating time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Having followed his older brother Evan into ice hockey, Jason began
                    traveling out of state to find better competition at age 10,
                    stopping in Los Angeles and Detroit before ending up with USA
                    Hockey's National Development Team Program in Ann Arbor, Mich., as a
                    teenager.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Zucker was one of two players to win three gold medals within a
                    calendar year, helping the United States win the World Junior
                    Under-18 tournaments in 2009 and 2010 as well as gold at the 2010
                    World Junior Championship. Zucker, who scored two goals in seven
                    games as one of the youngest players on that U.S. world junior team
                    in 2010, represented the U.S. twice more at the event, winning a
                    bronze medal in 2011.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Already committed to the University of Denver before being drafted
                    by the Wild in 2010, Zucker played two seasons there. He had 45
                    goals and 91 points in 78 college games and turned pro at the end of
                    the 2011-12 season.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As fast as Zucker is, his NHL career started slowly; he had eight
                    goals and 12 points over 47 games between the tail end of the
                    2011-12 season and the 2013-14 season.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Zucker moved between the American Hockey League and the NHL during
                    the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season and scored his first NHL goal
                    in a 3-2 win against Detroit on Feb. 17, 2013.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A torn quadriceps cut short Zucker's 2013-14 season before he broke
                    out in 2014-15 with 21 goals in 51 games, good enough to finish 10th
                    in the NHL with a 16.9% shooting percentage. On Oct. 25, 2015,
                    Zucker set a Wild franchise record by scoring 10 seconds into a 5-4
                    win against the Winnipeg Jets.

                Eric is one of many NHL stars grateful for the league’s crackdown on
                clutching and grabbing in the neutral zone. <span id="dots">...
                </span><span id="more"> Though he’s big and
                    physical, he is at his best in open ice when he can use his speed,
                    vision and stickhandling skills to his advantage.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While Eric likes to control the puck, he knows how to create space
                    for himself when he doesn’t have it. This, combined with a quick,
                    accurate shot, makes him a dangerous goal scorer. Eric, however, is
                    most dangerous as a playmaker. He is a great passer who regularly
                    sets up teammates with good scoring chances.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Eric is the rare young player who understands his responsibilities
                    on both ends of the ice. While not a grinder, he’s more than willing
                    to mix it up in the corners. Thanks to his long reach and quick
                    hands, he’s also excellent on faceoffs. Not surprisingly, Eric is
                    usually on the ice with the game on the line and his team up by a
                    goal.

                    Due to his hard work off the ice, Eric thrives the more ice time he
                    gets. He’s particularly effective in the third period. His work
                    ethic and production have earned the respect of his teammates and
                    make him a natural leader.

            <p class="card-text">
                Eriksson Ek, a forward born in Karlstad, Sweden, was chosen by the
                Minnesota Wild with the No. 20 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. <span id="dots">...

                    <br />
                    Eriksson Ek played one season for Farjestad in the Swedish Hockey
                    League, where his father Clas Eriksson played 13 seasons, before he
                    was selected by the Wild. He signed a three-year contract with
                    Minnesota on July 13, 2015, spent one more season in Sweden, then
                    came to North America and scored his NHL debut, a 2-1 loss to the
                    New Jersey Devils on Oct. 22, 2016. Eriksson Ek had six points
                    (three goals, three assists) before he was reassigned to Farjestad
                    to preserve his entry-level contract. He returned for the Wild's
                    final five games of the season.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Eriksson Ek played 75 games for the Wild in 2017-18, finishing with
                    16 points (six goals, 10 assists). After scoring on opening night
                    against the Detroit Red Wings, he went 50 games without a goal until
                    scoring in a 5-3 win against the New York Islanders on Feb. 19,
                    2018.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    His brother, Olle Eriksson Ek, was a fifth-round pick (No. 153) by
                    the Anaheim Ducks in the 2017 NHL Draft.

            <h5 class="card-title">Eric Fehr | #21</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Selected by the Washington Capitals with the No. 18 pick in the 2003
                NHL Draft, Fehr was a junior scoring star with Brandon in the
                Western Hockey League, <span id="dots">...
                </span><span id="more"> posting back-to-back 50-goal seasons in 2004
                    and 2005. Fehr's 111 points in 2005 led the league and he was named
                    the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy winner as the player of the year.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The honors continued his first year as a pro in 2005-06 when he
                    scored 25 goals to lead Hershey of the American Hockey League to the
                    Calder Cup.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Unfortunately, that's when injuries hit. Before Fehr could land a
                    regular spot in the Washington lineup he was diagnosed with a
                    herniated disc in his back in late February 2007. He did not return
                    until Feb. 5, 2008. Surgery on both shoulders curtailed Fehr's
                    scoring in 2008-09 and 2010-11, although he had 21 goals and 39
                    points in 69 games in 2009-10.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Fehr was traded to the Winnipeg Jets before the 2011-12 season, but
                    after one season returned to the Capitals as a free agent and
                    rejuvenated his career in a different role. Instead of serving as a
                    potential top-six scoring threat, Fehr was used in more of a
                    lower-line role where he thrived, getting 41 goals in three seasons.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Though Fehr underwent elbow surgery following the 2014-15 season, he
                    signed a three-year contract with Pittsburgh and turned into a
                    shutdown center for the 2016 Stanley Cup champions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Fehr is also an author. He co-wrote "The Bulliest Dozer," an
                    anti-bullying story for children published in 2014, with proceeds
                    going to charity.

                Drafted at No. 6 by the Wild in 2001, their second year, Koivu became Minnesota's captain in 2009.

                    The younger brother of former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu and son of former Finnish elite
                    league coach Jukka Koivu, Mikko made his Wild debut in a 3-1 win over the San Jose Sharks on
                    Nov. 5, 2005. One night later he scored his first NHL goal in a 4-3 win against the Mighty Ducks of
                    Anaheim,
                    the first of six goals and 21 points he would score in 64 games that season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A gifted skater with the same tenacity of his older brother, Koivu established himself as one
                    of the top two-way centers in the NHL in his second year. He played all 82 games in 2006-07 and had
                    20 goals and 54 points while earning his first votes for the Selke Trophy, awarded to the NHL's best
                    defensive forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the next three seasons, Koivu scored 20 goals twice. He broke his leg early in the 2007-08
                    season,
                    forcing him to miss 24 games, but he finished eighth in Selke voting that season and tied for fourth
                    the next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Koivu recorded his 500th career point on April 9, 2015, making him the first Wild player and the
                    10th
                    Finnish player to reach that mark in the NHL.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the 2015-16 season Koivu broke Nick Schultz's team record of 743 games played. </p>

                Rask was 2 years old when he started playing hockey, and it wasn't long
                before the decision to put him on skates so soon in life began to pay dividends.<span id="dots">...

                    <br>
                    A left-hand shooting center, Rask moved quickly through the hockey programs around his
                    hometown of Leksand, Sweden, and became a fixture on junior national teams.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sweden won five medals during Rask's four years, including silver at the 2010 and 2011
                    World Under-18 Championship and gold at the 2012 World Junior Championship.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following the second U-18 silver medal, the Hurricanes selected Rask in the second round
                    (No. 42) in the 2011 NHL Draft.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In three years splitting time with Calgary of the Western Hockey League
                    (47 goals, 104 points, 101 games) and Charlotte of the American Hockey League
                    (17 goals, 44 points, 86 games), Rask made the Carolina Hurricanes roster out of
                    training camp for the 2014-15 season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Playing 80 games, Rask finished tied for fourth in points (33), tied for third in assists
                    (22), fifth in goals (11) and ranked 10th among all NHL rookies in points.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Capable of working on any of the top three lines, Rask broke out as a goal-scorer a year later,
                    scoring 21 times (second to Jeff Skinner's 28), and was second on the Hurricanes with 48 points.
